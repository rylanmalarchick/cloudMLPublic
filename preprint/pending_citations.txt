PAPER 1: NASA ER-2 Airborne CBH Retrieval
================================================================================

Working Title: 
  Cloud Base Height Retrieval from NASA ER-2 Airborne Observations using 
  Machine Learning

Authors: Malarchick R

Status: In preparation

Narrative Focus:
  "We developed ML methods to retrieve cloud base height from NASA ER-2 
  high-altitude observations, validating against CPL lidar ground truth"

Key Content (from Jan 7 preprint):
  - NASA ER-2 platform: CPL lidar (532nm, 30m vertical resolution), 
    downward-looking camera (1024x1024), flight metadata (1 Hz GPS)

  - Dataset: 1,426 samples from 3 flights (Flight 1: 1,021, Flight 2: 129, 
    Flight 3: 276)
  - CBH range: 210-1,950m (mean 1,197m)
  - Within-campaign performance: R² = 0.744, MAE = 117.4m
  - Production deployment: 0.28ms inference, 1.3MB model, CPU-only
  - Physical validation: Zero constraint violations, LCL correlation r=0.26

PAPER 2: ERA5 Feature Engineering for Atmospheric ML
================================================================================

Working Title:
  Physics-Informed Feature Engineering for Atmospheric Remote Sensing: 
  Domain Shift and Uncertainty Quantification Challenges

Authors: Malarchick R

Status: In preparation

Narrative Focus:
  "We systematically compare physics-informed ERA5 features vs. image-based 
  deep learning for atmospheric remote sensing, revealing critical domain 
  shift challenges and proposing practical solutions"

Key Content (from Jan 7 preprint):
  - ERA5 reanalysis: 0.25° resolution, 37 pressure levels, hourly
  - Feature engineering: 10 base features + 28 physics-based derived = 38 total
    * Base: t2m, d2m, sp, blh, tcwv, lcl, stability_index, moisture_gradient, 
      sza_deg, saa_deg
    * Derived: virtual_temperature (33% importance), stability_x_tcwv (22%), 
      thermodynamic interactions, LCL-based features
  - Model comparison: GBDT vs SimpleCNN vs ResNet-18 vs EfficientNet-B0
    * GBDT: R²=0.744, MAE=117.4m (per-flight shuffled)
    * ResNet-18 scratch: R²=0.617, MAE=150.9m (best vision model)
    * GBDT outperforms by 22.2% on MAE
  - Validation methodology critique:
    * Pooled K-fold inflated: R²=0.924 (temporal autocorrelation ρ=0.94)
    * Per-flight shuffled (honest): R²=0.744
    * Time-ordered holdout: R²=-0.055
  - Domain shift analysis:
    * LOFO-CV: mean R²=-15.4 (catastrophic failure)
    * K-S divergence shows d2m, t2m, sp most divergent (K-S > 0.4)
    * PCA: flights cluster by campaign (PC1: 36%, PC2: 14.4%)
  - Domain adaptation methods (5 evaluated):
    * Few-shot learning: 50 samples → R²=0.57-0.85 (RECOMMENDED)
    * Instance weighting: R²=-21.4 (worse than baseline)
    * TrAdaBoost: R²=-0.41 (modest improvement)
    * MMD alignment: R²=-39.4 (destroys signal)
  - Uncertainty quantification:
    * Split conformal: 27% coverage (target 90%) - FAILS
    * Per-flight calibration: 86% coverage, 313m intervals - WORKS
  - Computational efficiency:
    * GBDT: 0.28ms inference, 1.3MB, CPU-only
    * ResNet-18: 2.62ms, 42.7MB, GPU preferred
    * 9.3x faster, 33x smaller

WORK PLAN - Paper Development
================================================================================

Status: WAITING for Dr. Dong Wu's annotations on preprint

Next Steps:
  [ ] Receive and review Dr. Dong's annotations
  [ ] Clarify which content belongs to which paper per NASA team input
  [ ] Draft Paper 1 (ER-2 focus) - methods paper framing
  [ ] Draft Paper 2 (ERA5 focus) - methods paper framing  
  [ ] Identify target journals/conferences for each
  [ ] Update .tex files in repo
  [ ] Compile and verify PDFs match intended content

Content Split Guidelines (pending Dong's feedback):
  - Paper 1 emphasizes: ER-2 platform capabilities, CPL validation, 
    operational deployment for NASA missions
  - Paper 2 emphasizes: ML methodology, validation critique, domain 
    adaptation, uncertainty quantification generalizable to other 
    atmospheric sensing problems

Notes:
  - Both papers are "methods papers" not "dataset papers"
  - Paper 1: "here's our limited airborne data, here are methods we 
    developed and applied for NASA remote sensing"
  - Paper 2: "here's why physics-informed features beat deep learning for 
    atmospheric ML, and the domain shift problem everyone needs to address"
  - The .tex in repo currently matches Jan 6 version (933 samples, 18 features)
  - Need to update .tex to match Jan 7 version before splitting
