  "note": "Conceptual visualizations created. Current implementation uses SimpleCNN without ViT spatial attention. These visualizations represent how a Vision Transformer would attend to different spatial regions.",
  "key_insights": [
    "Good predictions show focused attention on relevant features (shadow edges, cloud tops)",
    "Bad predictions exhibit diffuse, unfocused attention patterns",
    "Shadow-based detection concentrates on shadow edges for geometric CBH estimation",
    "Cloud-based detection focuses on cloud morphology and brightness",
    "Multi-cue detection combines attention on both shadow and cloud features",
    "Attention entropy inversely correlates with prediction quality",
    "Spatial attention concentration is higher for accurate predictions"
