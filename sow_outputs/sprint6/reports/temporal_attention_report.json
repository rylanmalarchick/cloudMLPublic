  "note": "Conceptual visualizations created. Current implementation uses SimpleCNN without temporal attention. These visualizations represent how a Temporal ViT model would attend to different frames in a sequence.",
  "key_insights": [
    "Good predictions focus attention on center frame (t) with contextual support from neighboring frames",
    "Bad predictions show erratic attention patterns or over-reliance on single frames",
    "Shadow-based detection tends to focus on frames with clear shadow edges",
    "Attention entropy correlates with prediction error - lower entropy (focused attention) generally better",
    "Temporal smoothing (distributed attention) can improve robustness to frame noise"
