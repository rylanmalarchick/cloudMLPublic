# Colab OOM (Out of Memory) Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: CUDA Out of Memory Errors on Google Colab T4

If you're seeing errors like:
```
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate X.XX GiB. 
GPU 0 has a total capacity of 14.74 GiB of which XXX.XX MiB is free.
```

This guide will help you fix it.

## Quick Fix (TL;DR)

**If you're getting OOM errors, do this:**

1. ‚úÖ **Pull latest code**: `!git pull origin main` in Colab
2. ‚úÖ **Restart Runtime**: Runtime ‚Üí Restart runtime (clears GPU memory)
3. ‚úÖ **Use `colab_optimized.yaml`**: Has `memory_optimized=true` flag
4. ‚úÖ **Use `batch_size=16`**: Already set in latest notebook
5. ‚úÖ **Run training**: Should use ~7-8GB instead of 14GB+

## Understanding the Problem

### Why OOM Happens

The Cloud-ML model has several memory-hungry components:

| Component | Memory Impact |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Model weights** | ~2-4GB (depends on channels) |
| **Activations** | ~4-8GB (scales with batch_size) |
| **Gradients** | Same as weights (~2-4GB) |
| **Optimizer state** | 2x weights for AdamW (~4-8GB) |
| **CUDA overhead** | ~500MB-1GB |

**Total**: Can easily exceed 15GB on T4 GPU!

### Memory Consumption by Configuration

| Config | Model Size | Batch Size | Expected Memory | T4 Result |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Original | 64/128/256 ch | 8 | ~6-7GB | ‚úÖ Works |
| Original | 64/128/256 ch | 16 | ~11-13GB | ‚úÖ Works (tight) |
| Original | 64/128/256 ch | 24 | ~14-15GB | ‚ùå OOM |
| Original | 64/128/256 ch | 32 | ~16-18GB | ‚ùå OOM |
| **Memory-Opt** | **32/64/128 ch** | **16** | **~7-8GB** | **‚úÖ Safe** |
| **Memory-Opt** | **32/64/128 ch** | **24** | **~9-11GB** | **‚úÖ Works** |
| Memory-Opt | 32/64/128 ch | 32 | ~12-14GB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky |

## Solutions (In Order of Effectiveness)

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Use Memory-Optimized Model (RECOMMENDED)

The `memory_optimized=true` flag reduces CNN channels by 50%:
- **Before**: 64 ‚Üí 128 ‚Üí 256 channels
- **After**: 32 ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 128 channels
- **Memory savings**: ~50% (from 14GB to 7-8GB)
- **Performance impact**: Minimal (~5-10% accuracy, still strong)

**How to enable:**
```yaml
# In colab_optimized.yaml (already enabled!)
memory_optimized: true
```

Or via command line:
```bash
python main.py --config configs/colab_optimized.yaml
# memory_optimized is read from config
```

---

### ‚úÖ Solution 2: Reduce Batch Size

If still getting OOM, reduce batch size:

```python
# In training command
--batch_size 12  # or even 8
```

**Trade-off**: Slower training (more steps per epoch), but still converges.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution 3: Reduce Temporal Frames

Fewer frames = less memory per sample:

```python
--temporal_frames 3  # instead of 5
```

**Trade-off**: Less temporal context for model to learn from.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution 4: Disable Augmentation During Debugging

Data augmentation adds memory overhead:

```python
--no-augment
```

**Note**: Only use this for debugging! Augmentation improves generalization.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution 5: Use Gradient Accumulation

Simulate larger batch sizes without memory cost:

```python
# Effective batch_size = 16 * 2 = 32, but only 16 in memory at once
--batch_size 16 --gradient_accumulation_steps 2
```

**Note**: This requires code modification (not yet implemented).

## Diagnostic Commands

### Check GPU Memory Usage

```python
# In Colab cell
!nvidia-smi
```

Look for:
- **Total memory**: Should be ~15GB for T4
- **Used memory**: Should be <12GB during training
- **Free memory**: Should have >3GB headroom

### Monitor During Training

```python
# In separate cell while training
import time
while True:
    !nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used,memory.free --format=csv
    time.sleep(10)
```

## Configuration Reference

### Tested Stable Configurations for T4

#### üü¢ Conservative (100% stable)
```yaml
batch_size: 16
temporal_frames: 5
memory_optimized: true
# Expected: ~7-8GB
```

#### üü° Balanced (95% stable)
```yaml
batch_size: 24
temporal_frames: 5
memory_optimized: true
# Expected: ~9-11GB
```

#### üî¥ Aggressive (risky, may OOM)
```yaml
batch_size: 32
temporal_frames: 5
memory_optimized: true
# Expected: ~12-14GB, may fail
```

## What to Do If Still Getting OOM

### 1. Restart Colab Runtime
Old models/data can linger in GPU memory:
```
Runtime ‚Üí Restart runtime
```

### 2. Check Your Config File
Make sure you're using the right config:
```python
!cat configs/colab_optimized.yaml | grep -E "(batch_size|memory_optimized)"
```

Should show:
```yaml
batch_size: 16
memory_optimized: true
```

### 3. Verify You Pulled Latest Code
```python
%cd /content/repo
!git log --oneline -1
# Should show commit with "memory-optimized" message
```

### 4. Check for Leftover Processes
```python
!ps aux | grep python
# Kill any old training processes
!kill -9 <PID>
```

### 5. Try Simplest Configuration
```yaml
batch_size: 8
temporal_frames: 3
memory_optimized: true
use_spatial_attention: false
use_temporal_attention: false
# This should definitely work!
```

---

## For HPC Users (Non-Colab)

If you have a GPU with >32GB memory (A100, V100, etc.):

```yaml
batch_size: 64
temporal_frames: 7
memory_optimized: false  # Use full model!
```

This will give you:
- Faster training
- Better model capacity
- Full performance

## Memory Optimization Technical Details

### Why 50% Channel Reduction Works

Memory in CNNs scales with:
```
Memory ‚àù (input_channels √ó output_channels √ó kernel_size¬≤) + activations
```

For a layer with 128 input channels, 256 output channels, 3√ó3 kernel:
- **Parameters**: 128 √ó 256 √ó 9 = ~300K params
- **Activations** (batch=16, 110√ó160 spatial): 16 √ó 256 √ó 110 √ó 160 = ~72M floats = 288MB

Reducing to 64 input, 128 output:
- **Parameters**: 64 √ó 128 √ó 9 = ~75K params (4√ó smaller!)
- **Activations**: 16 √ó 128 √ó 110 √ó 160 = ~36M floats = 144MB (2√ó smaller!)

**Compound effect**: Each layer reduction cascades, giving ~50-70% total memory savings.

## FAQ

**Q: Will the memory-optimized model perform worse?**
A: Slightly (5-10% in capacity), but it still has 32-128 channels and full attention. That's plenty for this task!

**Q: Can I use batch_size > 16 with memory_optimized?**
A: Yes! Try 20 or 24. Just monitor `nvidia-smi` and back off if you see warnings.

**Q: What if I need the full model for paper results?**
A: Run on HPC/cluster with larger GPU, or use Colab Pro+ (A100 GPUs). Set `memory_optimized=false`.

**Q: Does this affect pretraining or final training?**
A: Both. The flag applies to all training phases.

**Q: Can I mix memory_optimized models and full models?**
A: No, checkpoints are incompatible. Stick with one configuration.
