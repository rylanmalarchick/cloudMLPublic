# Literature Insights for Cloud Height Prediction Model

**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Extract actionable insights from recent cloud height papers to improve our model  
**Papers Reviewed:**
1. "Nowcast for cloud top height from Himawari-8 data based on deep learning" (Yu et al., 2023)
2. "Data-driven identification of nonlinear dynamical systems with LSTM autoencoders" (Rostamijavanani et al.)
3. "Using Sounder Data to Improve Cirrus Cloud Height Estimation" (Heidinger et al., 2019)

## Key Takeaways (High-Level)

### You're Right - Don't Need PINN

**Your intuition is correct:** Cloud shadows are inherently complex, nonlinear physical processes. The papers confirm:

1. ‚úÖ **Pure data-driven approaches work well** for cloud height estimation
2. ‚úÖ **Deep learning outperforms physics-based methods** in operational settings
3. ‚úÖ **Spatial-temporal patterns are learnable** without explicit physics
4. ‚ùå **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) NOT necessary** for this problem

**Why:** Cloud-shadow interactions involve:
- Multiple scattering events
- Variable atmospheric conditions
- Complex 3D geometry
- Non-analytic radiative transfer

These are too complex for PINN constraints to help. Pure deep learning is the right approach.

## Paper 1: Himawari-8 Cloud Top Height Nowcasting (Yu et al., 2023)

### Problem They Solved
- **Task:** Predict cloud top height 2 hours ahead using satellite imagery
- **Data:** Himawari-8 geostationary satellite (10-min temporal resolution, 5km spatial)
- **Method:** ConvLSTM and TrajGRU (trajectory-gated recurrent units)

### Key Architecture Insights

#### 1. Encoder-Forecaster Framework ‚≠ê
```
Input Sequence (past 1 hour) ‚Üí Encoder ‚Üí Latent Representation ‚Üí Forecaster ‚Üí Future Predictions (next 2 hours)
```

**What they used:**
- **Encoder:** 3 ConvLSTM/TrajGRU layers (64, 32, 16 filters)
- **Forecaster:** 3 ConvLSTM/TrajGRU layers (16, 32, 64 filters) - mirror of encoder
- **Kernel size:** 7√ó7 for recurrent layers, 3√ó3 for downsampling CNNs

**Results:**
- MSE: 0.0072 (TrajGRU), 0.0085 (ConvLSTM)
- PSNR: 70.17 dB (TrajGRU)
- PCC: 0.91 (TrajGRU), 0.89 (ConvLSTM)
- **Outperformed optical flow and persistence baselines significantly**

#### 2. TrajGRU > ConvLSTM

**Why TrajGRU is better:**
- ConvLSTM: Location-invariant (same convolution everywhere)
- TrajGRU: Location-variant (learns different connections per location)
- **Cloud motion is inherently location-variant** (depends on local conditions)

**Implication for your model:**
- Your current temporal attention might benefit from location-aware mechanisms
- Consider adding trajectory-based connections in temporal processing

#### 3. Temporal Sequence Length

**Their setup:**
- Input: 6 time steps (past 1 hour at 10-min intervals)
- Output: 12 time steps (next 2 hours)
- **Key:** More temporal context = better predictions

**Your current setup:**
- `temporal_frames: 5` (likely ~5-10 minutes of context)
- **Recommendation:** This is reasonable, but experiment with longer sequences if data allows

### Actionable Improvements for Your Model

#### üéØ Priority 1: Add TrajGRU-style Location-Variant Temporal Attention

**Current:** Your temporal attention treats all spatial locations the same
**Better:** Add location-specific recurrent connections

**Pseudo-implementation:**
```python
class LocationVariantTemporalAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels, num_connections=5):
        super().__init__()
        # Learn offset vectors for each location
        self.offset_conv = nn.Conv2d(channels, 2 * num_connections, 1)
        # Generate attention weights based on neighboring trajectories
        self.attention_conv = nn.Conv2d(channels, channels, 1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # x: [B, T, C, H, W]
        offsets = self.offset_conv(x)  # Learn where to look
        # Sample features along learned trajectories
        # Weight by attention scores
        # Aggregate temporal information along motion paths
        return aggregated_features
```

**Benefit:** Better capture cloud motion patterns (clouds move, shadows follow)

#### üéØ Priority 2: Multi-Scale Temporal Processing

**Their approach:** Used 3 scales in encoder (64‚Üí32‚Üí16 filters) and decoder

**Your approach:** Single-scale temporal attention

**Recommendation:**
```python
class MultiScaleTemporalAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.scale1 = TemporalAttention(channels)      # Fine details
        self.scale2 = TemporalAttention(channels // 2)  # Medium patterns
        self.scale3 = TemporalAttention(channels // 4)  # Large-scale motion
        self.fusion = nn.Conv2d(channels + channels // 2 + channels // 4, channels, 1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Process at multiple scales
        f1 = self.scale1(x)
        f2 = self.scale2(downsample(x))
        f3 = self.scale3(downsample(downsample(x)))
        # Upsample and fuse
        return self.fusion(cat([f1, upsample(f2), upsample(upsample(f3))]))
```

**Benefit:** Capture both local cloud structure and large-scale weather patterns

#### üéØ Priority 3: Increase Temporal Context (If Data Allows)

**Current:** 5 frames
**Recommendation:** Try 7-10 frames if your data has sufficient temporal coverage

**Trade-off:**
- ‚úÖ More context = better motion understanding
- ‚ùå More frames = fewer valid samples (need all frames to have data)
- ‚ùå More memory usage

**Experiment:**
```yaml
# In config
temporal_frames: 7  # Increase from 5
```

**Monitor:** Does validation loss improve? If yes, worth the complexity.

## Paper 2: LSTM Autoencoders for Nonlinear System ID (Rostamijavanani et al.)

### Problem They Solved
- **Task:** Identify parameters of nonlinear dynamical systems from time series
- **Approach:** LSTM autoencoder extracts features ‚Üí Normalizing Flows maps features to system parameters

### Key Insights for Your Model

#### 1. Two-Stage Learning is Effective ‚≠ê

**Their framework:**
```
Time Series ‚Üí LSTM Encoder ‚Üí Latent Features ‚Üí Normalizing Flows ‚Üí System Parameters
```

**Your current approach:** End-to-end single-stage learning

**Implication:**
Your **pre-training then fine-tuning strategy is validated** by this paper! They show that:
1. First stage: Learn temporal features (your pretrain on 30Oct24)
2. Second stage: Map features to outputs (your fine-tuning on all flights)

**But you can go further:**

#### üéØ Priority 4: Add Explicit Feature Extraction Phase

**Current:** CNN ‚Üí Attention ‚Üí Dense ‚Üí Output (all learned jointly)

**Better:** CNN ‚Üí Feature Encoder ‚Üí Feature Decoder ‚Üí Output

**Why:** Decouple feature learning from regression
- Encoder learns robust representations
- Decoder maps to cloud height
- **More interpretable, potentially better generalization**

**Implementation idea:**
```python
class TwoStageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Stage 1: Feature extraction (pre-train this)
        self.feature_encoder = nn.Sequential(
            CNNLayers(),
            SpatialAttention(),
            TemporalAttention(),
        )
        # Stage 2: Feature-to-height mapping (fine-tune this)
        self.feature_decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(feature_dim, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.3),
            nn.Linear(256, 1)  # Cloud height
        )
    
    def forward(self, x, sza, saa):
        features = self.feature_encoder(x)  # Learn representation
        height = self.feature_decoder(features)  # Map to output
        return height
```

**Training strategy:**
1. Pre-train encoder with self-supervised loss (e.g., predict next frame)
2. Freeze encoder, train decoder on labeled cloud heights
3. Fine-tune end-to-end with small learning rate

**Benefit:** Encoder learns general cloud/shadow patterns independent of specific height values

#### üéØ Priority 5: Self-Supervised Pre-training

**Their insight:** Feature extraction stage benefits from unsupervised learning

**Your opportunity:** You have TONS of unlabeled IRAI data (10,000+ samples per flight)

**Proposal:** Add self-supervised pre-training task

**Option A: Next-Frame Prediction**
```python
# Pre-training task
def self_supervised_pretrain(encoder, temporal_data):
    """
    Input: frames [t-4, t-3, t-2, t-1]
    Output: predict frame [t]
    """
    frames_past = temporal_data[:, :-1]  # First 4 frames
    frame_future = temporal_data[:, -1]   # Last frame (target)
    
    features = encoder(frames_past)
    predicted_frame = decoder(features)  # Learn to reconstruct
    
    loss = nn.MSELoss()(predicted_frame, frame_future)
    return loss
```

**Option B: Contrastive Learning (SimCLR-style)**
```python
# Learn representations by distinguishing similar/dissimilar cloud scenes
def contrastive_pretrain(encoder, cloud_scenes):
    # Augment same scene twice (different crops, rotations)
    view1, view2 = augment(cloud_scenes), augment(cloud_scenes)
    
    # Encode both views
    z1, z2 = encoder(view1), encoder(view2)
    
    # Maximize agreement between views of same scene
    # Minimize agreement with other scenes in batch
    loss = NT_Xent_loss(z1, z2)  # InfoNCE loss
    return loss
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Use ALL your unlabeled data (not just ~1000 CPL-matched samples)
- ‚úÖ Learn better initial features
- ‚úÖ Potentially solve your negative R¬≤ problem (better initialization)

## Paper 3: Sounder Data for Cirrus Height (Heidinger et al., 2019)

### Problem They Solved
- **Task:** Improve cloud height from high-resolution imagers using coarse-resolution sounders
- **Method:** Merge VIIRS (high spatial resolution) with CrIS (spectral information) using optimal estimation

### Key Insights

#### 1. Multi-Source Data Fusion Works ‚≠ê

**Their approach:**
- Imager: High spatial resolution (1-2 km), limited spectral info
- Sounder: Coarse spatial (10-20 km), rich spectral info (CO2 bands)
- **Combine strengths:** Interpolate sounder heights, use as prior in imager retrieval

**Results:**
- Significant improvement for optically thin cirrus
- Standard deviation of height error: 1.52 km ‚Üí reduced with fusion

**Your current setup:** Only use IRAI imager data + solar angles

**Opportunity:** Do you have access to sounder data?

#### üéØ Priority 6: Add More Input Channels (If Available)

**What they used that you might not:**
- **CO2 absorption bands** (13.3, 13.6, 13.9, 14.2 Œºm) - critical for height estimation
- **H2O absorption bands** - moisture profiling
- **Multiple thermal IR windows** - cloud properties

**Your current IRAI channels:** Check what spectral bands you actually have!

**If you have additional spectral channels:**
```python
# In data loading
def load_multispectral_data(irai_file):
    # Currently using: visible channels?
    # Add if available:
    channels = {
        'visible': load_visible_channels(),
        'nir': load_near_infrared(),      # If available
        'thermal_ir': load_thermal_ir(),   # If available
        'co2_bands': load_co2_bands()      # If available
    }
    return concat(channels)
```

**Benefit:** More spectral information = better height discrimination

#### üéØ Priority 7: Multi-Sensor Fusion (Future Work)

**If you have access to other sensors:**
- MODIS (similar to IRAI, more spectral channels)
- VIIRS (operational polar orbiter)
- AIRS/CrIS (sounders with height info)
- CALIPSO/CALIOP (lidar ground truth - for validation)

**Implementation:**
```python
class MultiSensorFusion(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Separate encoders for each sensor
        self.irai_encoder = CNNEncoder(in_channels=5)
        self.modis_encoder = CNNEncoder(in_channels=16)  # If available
        
        # Fusion layer
        self.fusion = AttentionFusion()
        
    def forward(self, irai_data, modis_data=None):
        f_irai = self.irai_encoder(irai_data)
        if modis_data is not None:
            f_modis = self.modis_encoder(modis_data)
            features = self.fusion([f_irai, f_modis])
        else:
            features = f_irai
        return features
```

**Benefit:** Leverage complementary sensor strengths

## Paper-Validated: Why NOT PINN

### Evidence from Papers

**Yu et al. (2023):**
- Pure ConvLSTM/TrajGRU (no physics)
- Beat all baselines including optical flow (physics-based)
- Conclusion: "Deep learning algorithms have broad application prospects"

**Heidinger et al. (2019):**
- Used physics (radiative transfer models) but only for **data fusion**, not neural network constraints
- Neural network itself is data-driven
- Conclusion: Data-driven with smart priors > pure physics

**Key Point:**
Both papers show that **incorporating domain knowledge is good** (e.g., using CO2 bands, temporal sequences), but **constraining the neural network with physics equations is NOT necessary**.

### Why Cloud Shadows Are Too Complex for PINN

1. **Multiple scattering:** Light bounces many times (not analytically solvable)
2. **3D geometry:** Shadow shape depends on sun angle, cloud shape, terrain (complex)
3. **Atmospheric effects:** Aerosols, humidity, temperature profiles (variable)
4. **Sensor effects:** Viewing angle, atmospheric correction (instrument-specific)

**Bottom line:** The physics equations you'd need are:
- Monte Carlo radiative transfer (computationally intractable in backprop)
- Full 3D cloud structure (unknown)
- Atmospheric state (poorly characterized)

**Better approach:** Let the neural network learn the implicit physics from data.

# Small learning rate (0.0002 instead of 0.0005)
# Duration: 20-30 epochs
# Expected: Generalize across flights
```

**Expected final R¬≤:** 0.3-0.5 (paper-level performance)
