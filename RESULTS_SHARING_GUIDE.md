# Results Sharing Guide: Iterative Model Refinement

This guide explains how to share your experimental results for collaborative analysis and iterative improvement.

---

## üéØ Overview

This is an **iterative research process**. After each round of experiments:
1. You run experiments and collect results
2. Share results in formats described below
3. We analyze together and identify improvements
4. Refine the model/training/architecture
5. Repeat until publication-ready

---

## üì§ What to Share After Each Experiment Round

### Priority 1: Metrics Summary (REQUIRED)

**Format**: Copy-paste from notebook or CSV

**What to include**:
```
=== BASELINE RESULTS ===
MAE:  X.XXX km
RMSE: X.XXX km
R¬≤:   X.XXX
MAPE: XX.XX%

Training time: X.X hours
GPU usage: XX GB
Converged at epoch: XX

=== ABLATION RESULTS ===
| Experiment              | MAE    | RMSE   | R¬≤    | Œî MAE vs Baseline |
|-------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Baseline (Full)         | X.XXX  | X.XXX  | 0.XXX | -                 |
| w/o Spatial Attention   | X.XXX  | X.XXX  | 0.XXX | +XX.X%            |
| w/o Temporal Attention  | X.XXX  | X.XXX  | 0.XXX | +XX.X%            |
| ...                     | ...    | ...    | ...   | ...               |
```

**Why**: This is the core data for deciding next steps.

---

### Priority 2: Training Curves (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

**Format**: Screenshots or download images from TensorBoard/plots

**What to include**:
- Training loss curve (epochs vs loss)
- Validation loss curve (epochs vs loss)
- Note where early stopping triggered

**Example request**:
```
"Here's the training curve - validation loss plateaued around epoch 35"
[attach image]
```

**Why**: Reveals if model is:
- Underfitting (both losses high)
- Overfitting (val loss increases while train decreases)
- Converging properly (both decrease and plateau)
- Needing more epochs, different LR, etc.

---

### Priority 3: Error Analysis (RECOMMENDED)

**Format**: Screenshots of plots or describe patterns

**What to share**:
1. **Predicted vs Ground Truth scatter plot**
   - Are predictions systematically biased?
   - Is there a linear relationship?
   - Where do largest errors occur?

2. **Error distribution histogram**
   - Are errors normally distributed?
   - Are there outliers?
   - Is the model biased (mean error ‚â† 0)?

3. **Per-flight performance breakdown**
   - Which flights perform best/worst?
   - Any patterns by date, location, conditions?

**Example**:
```
"The model underpredicts for high CBH values (>1.5km) but is accurate for low CBH.
Error histogram shows right skew - a few large positive errors."
```

**Why**: Identifies specific weaknesses to target in next iteration.

---

### Priority 4: Observations & Questions (HELPFUL)

**Share your intuitions**:
- What surprised you?
- What seemed wrong or unexpected?
- What do you think should be changed?
- Any training instabilities or warnings?

**Example**:
```
"The 'no temporal attention' ablation only dropped MAE by 2%, 
which seems small. Should temporal frames matter more?
Also, training was unstable around epoch 15 - loss spiked briefly."
```

**Why**: Your domain knowledge + observations are valuable! Often you'll notice patterns I can't see from just numbers.

## üìä How to Extract Results from Colab

### Method 1: Copy from Notebook Output (Easiest)

After training completes, scroll up and copy:
```python
# The final metrics are printed at the end of training
# Example output:
"""
=== Final Evaluation ===
MAE: 0.234 km
RMSE: 0.312 km
R¬≤: 0.876
"""
```

### Method 2: Download CSV Files

```python
# In Colab, after experiments complete:
from google.colab import files

# Download metrics CSV
files.download('/content/drive/MyDrive/CloudML/logs/csv/baseline_paper_*.csv')

# Download aggregated results
files.download('/content/drive/MyDrive/CloudML/all_results_combined.csv')
```

Then attach the CSV file(s) in your message.

### Method 3: Share Google Drive Link

```python
# Make files accessible (if private Drive)
# 1. Right-click file in Drive
# 2. Get link ‚Üí Anyone with link can view
# 3. Share the link
```

Works for:
- CSV files
- Plot images
- TensorBoard logs (zipped)
- Model checkpoints (if needed)

### Method 4: Screenshot Plots

In Colab, plots are displayed in cells. Just:
1. Right-click plot ‚Üí Save image as...
2. Or use screenshot tool
3. Attach in message

## üîç What We'll Analyze Together

Based on your results, we can:

### 1. Diagnose Training Issues
- **Underfitting**: Need more capacity, more epochs, or lower regularization
- **Overfitting**: Need more data aug, dropout, or early stopping
- **Instability**: Adjust learning rate, batch size, or gradient clipping
- **Slow convergence**: Learning rate schedule, warmup, or optimizer change

### 2. Identify Model Weaknesses
- **High errors on certain CBH ranges**: May need specialized loss or sampling
- **Poor generalization to some flights**: May need domain adaptation or better features
- **Attention not helping**: Architecture issue - maybe CBAM, or remove entirely
- **Temporal frames not contributing**: Maybe cloud motion is too slow

### 3. Prioritize Next Experiments
Based on ablations, we can decide:
- Which components are working (keep them)
- Which aren't helping (remove for efficiency)
- What new things to try (different architectures, losses, features)

### 4. Optimize Efficiency
- Identify bottlenecks (data loading, GPU usage, architecture)
- Find optimal batch size / temporal frames tradeoff
- Reduce training time without hurting performance

### 5. Plan Paper Narrative
- Structure ablations to tell a story
- Identify key results for main paper vs supplementary
- Design figures that highlight contributions

## üîÑ Typical Iteration Cycle

### Round 1: Baseline + Ablations (CURRENT)
**You run**: Baseline + 8 ablations from notebook
**You share**: Metrics table, training curves, observations
**We discuss**: 
- Is baseline strong enough?
- Which ablations show biggest impact?
- Any unexpected results?
**We decide**: 
- Keep working components
- Remove ineffective ones
- Identify new things to try

### Round 2: Refinement
**You run**: Modified experiments based on Round 1 insights
Examples:
- Different temporal frames if ablation showed impact
- Modified architecture if attention isn't helping
- Different loss function if errors are skewed
- Additional data augmentation if overfitting
**You share**: New results vs baseline
**We discuss**: Improvements? New issues?

### Round 3+: Optimization
**You run**: Fine-tuning and final experiments
- Hyperparameter sweeps (LR, weight decay, etc.)
- Ensemble methods
- Additional architectures for comparison
**You share**: Final results, ready for paper

### Final: Paper Prep
**We collaborate on**:
- Structuring results for maximum impact
- Creating effective figures and tables
- Writing clear ablation descriptions
- Ensuring reproducibility

## üí¨ Example Result Sharing (Good Format)

```
Hey! Just finished the baseline + ablations run. Here's what I got:

=== BASELINE ===
MAE: 0.187 km
RMSE: 0.265 km  
R¬≤: 0.891
Training: 2.5 hours, converged at epoch 42

=== ABLATIONS (Œî MAE vs baseline) ===
1. w/o Spatial Attention:  +8.2% (0.202 km)
2. w/o Temporal Attention: +12.4% (0.210 km)
3. w/o Both Attention:     +18.7% (0.222 km)
4. w/o Augmentation:       +3.1% (0.193 km)
5. MAE Loss:               +1.5% (0.190 km)
6. Fewer Frames (3):       +6.8% (0.200 km)
7. CNN Baseline:           +24.3% (0.232 km)

=== OBSERVATIONS ===
- Temporal attention seems more important than spatial (12.4% vs 8.2%)
- Transformer WAY better than CNN (24% improvement)
- Augmentation barely helps (3.1%) - maybe too conservative?
- Training was stable, no issues

=== QUESTIONS ===
1. Should we try more aggressive augmentation?
2. The temporal attention impact is interesting - maybe increase to 7 frames?
3. Is 0.187 km MAE good enough for the paper or should we push further?

**We'll check**: 
- Is model underfitting? (Add capacity)
- Is data too noisy? (Better preprocessing)
- Is evaluation fair? (Check data splits)

### "Ablation shows component doesn't help"
**Share**: Baseline vs ablation metrics + training curves for both
**We'll investigate**:
- Is component implemented correctly?
- Does it need different hyperparameters?
- Maybe it truly doesn't help (good to know!)

### "Training is unstable"
**Share**: Training curve showing instability + any error messages
**We'll fix**:
- Learning rate too high
