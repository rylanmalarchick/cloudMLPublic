# SECTION 2: RESULTS & ANALYSIS REPORT
## Model Collapse Investigation - Overnight Run Complete

**Run Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Duration**: 22:21 - 23:47 (1h 26m)  
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLETION WITH CRITICAL ISSUES

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Section 2 experiments encountered **critical training failures** that prevented meaningful completion. All experiments showed:
- ❌ **Catastrophically negative R² scores** (-4 to -16)
- ❌ **Training instability** (exploding losses, crashes)
- ❌ **Data loading errors** (missing 04Nov24 flight data)
- ⚠️ **Unexpected behavior**: Variance NOT collapsing (opposite of expected)

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The neural network is performing **worse than random guessing**, suggesting fundamental training issues beyond variance collapse.

## DETAILED RESULTS

### Experiment Completion Status

| Experiment | Lambda | Epochs | Status | Best R² | Final Variance Ratio |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Baseline | 0.0 | 15/15 | ✓ Complete | **-7.68** | 164.7% |
| Lambda 0.5 | 0.5 | 13/15 | ✗ Crashed | **-4.54** | 199.9% |
| Lambda 1.0 | 1.0 | 13/15 | ✗ Crashed | **-4.42** | 196.2% |
| Lambda 2.0 | 2.0 | 13/15 | ✗ Crashed | **-4.45** | 201.3% |
| Lambda 5.0 | 5.0 | 13/15 | ✗ Crashed | **-4.62** | 206.6% |
| Lambda 10.0 | 10.0 | 13/15 | ✗ Crashed | **-4.44** | 207.2% |

### Key Metrics

**Baseline (λ=0.0) - Only Complete Run**:
```
Epochs: 15/15
Final R²: -10.86
Best R²: -7.68 (Epoch 5)
Final Variance Ratio: 164.7%
Final Prediction Std: 1.22 km
Train Loss: 4.61
Val Loss: 1.87
```

**Variance Lambda Experiments (λ=0.5-10.0)**:
```

Best R²: -4.42 to -4.62
Variance Ratios: 196-207% (all over-predicting variance)
Train Losses: EXPLODING (828 to 26,207)
Val Losses: EXPLODING (6.7 to 9,576)
```

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: Missing Data File
**Error**: Flight `04Nov24` referenced in configs but no `.h5` file exists
```
Error: Unable to open file 'data/04Nov24/WHYMSIE2024_IRAI_L1B_Rev-_20241104.h5'
Result: IndexError crashes at epoch 14 in all lambda experiments
```

### Issue 2: Catastrophic Training Performance
**Problem**: All experiments achieved R² worse than -4.0
- Random guessing would give R² ≈ 0
- Section 1 baselines achieved R² = 0.75
- Neural networks should beat simple models, not fail catastrophically

### Issue 3: Loss Explosion
**Pattern**: Variance loss component causes training instability
```
Baseline (λ=0.0):  Train Loss = 4.6
Lambda 0.5:        Train Loss = 1,273
Lambda 1.0:        Train Loss = 2,555
Lambda 2.0:        Train Loss = 5,078
Lambda 5.0:        Train Loss = 12,789
Lambda 10.0:       Train Loss = 26,208
```
The variance loss term is **dominating and destabilizing** training.

### Issue 4: Unexpected Variance Behavior
**Hypothesis from Research Program**: Baseline should collapse (variance ratio < 20%)
**Actual Result**: Baseline maintains 165% variance ratio

This suggests:
- Variance collapse is NOT the primary failure mode
- The model is over-predicting variance, not under-predicting
- Different pathology than originally hypothesized

## COMPARISON TO SECTION 1 BASELINES

| Model | R² Score | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **GradientBoosting (Section 1)** | **+0.746** | ✅ Excellent |
| **RandomForest (Section 1)** | **+0.702** | ✅ Good |
| **SVR (Section 1)** | **+0.431** | ✅ Decent |
| Ridge (Section 1) | +0.161 | ✅ Positive |
| **Baseline NN (λ=0.0)** | **-10.86** | ❌ Catastrophic |
| **Best NN (λ=1.0)** | **-4.42** | ❌ Terrible |

**Gap**: Neural networks underperform simple models by **11+ R² points**.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Hypothesis: Incorrect Loss Function Configuration

The variance-preserving loss is calculated as:
```
L_var = (1 - σ²_pred / σ²_true)²
```

When variance ratio is high (200%), this term becomes:
```
L_var = (1 - 2.0²)² = (1 - 4.0)² = 9.0
```

With lambda values 0.5-10.0, this creates **massive penalty signals** that:
1. Dominate the base loss (Huber)
2. Push gradients to extremes
3. Cause numerical instability
4. Prevent meaningful learning

### Hypothesis: Wrong Learning Rate Schedule

Current config uses **linearly increasing LR**:
```
Epoch 1: LR = 0.000001
Epoch 15: LR = 0.000015
```

This is **backwards** from standard practice:
- Should start high, decrease over time
- Current schedule increases instability as training progresses

### Hypothesis: Data Preprocessing Issues

Variance ratio consistently > 100% suggests:
- Input normalization problems
- Target scaling issues
- Augmentation causing distribution shift

---

## WHAT SECTION 2 WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOW

### Expected Baseline (λ=0.0):
```
✓ R² < 0 (negative, around -0.05)
✓ Variance ratio < 20% (collapsed predictions)
✓ Narrow prediction distribution (all near mean)
→ Proves variance collapse is the problem
```

### Expected Optimal (λ=1-2):
```
✓ R² > 0.3 (positive, approaching simple baselines)
✓ Variance ratio ≈ 100% (distribution matching)
✓ Wide prediction distribution (matches targets)
→ Proves variance regularization fixes collapse
```

### Actual Results:
```
✗ R² = -10.86 (catastrophically negative)
✗ Variance ratio = 165% (OVER-predicting variance)
✗ Training unstable and divergent
→ Proves variance collapse is NOT the primary issue
```

---

## REVISED DIAGNOSIS

Based on Section 2 results, the **true failure mode** is:

1. **Not variance collapse** - Model maintains/over-predicts variance
2. **Likely gradient/optimization issues** - Loss explosion, instability
3. **Possible architecture mismatch** - Complex model can't learn from limited data
4. **Potential data quality issues** - Though Section 1 showed signal exists

The variance-preserving loss **makes things worse**, not better.

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Bugs
1. **Remove 04Nov24 from all configs** (no data file)
2. **Fix learning rate schedule** (use decreasing, not increasing)
3. **Test without variance loss** to establish clean baseline

### Priority 2: Diagnostic Deep Dive
Run targeted experiments to isolate failure:

**Experiment A: Simplest Possible Model**
```yaml
architecture: simple_cnn
epochs: 20
batch_size: 32
learning_rate: 0.001 (fixed)
variance_lambda: 0.0
early_stopping: off
```
→ Tests if architecture complexity is the issue

**Experiment B: Match Simple Model Success**
```yaml
Use only the 20 hand-crafted features (from Section 1)
Train linear model in PyTorch
Target: Reproduce R² = 0.75 from GradientBoosting
```
→ Tests if PyTorch setup itself works

**Experiment C: Single Flight Overfitting Test**
```yaml
Train on: 30Oct24 only
Validate on: 30Oct24 (same flight)
epochs: 50
```
→ Tests if model can learn anything at all

### Priority 3: Re-evaluate Research Direction

**Question**: Should we continue with neural networks?

**Evidence FOR continuing**:
- Section 1 proves signal exists (r² = 0.14, GradientBoosting R² = 0.75)
- Literature suggests deep learning should work for imagery
- May just need correct configuration

**Evidence AGAINST continuing**:
- 6 consecutive failures with different hyperparameters
- Simple models already achieve excellent performance (R² = 0.75)
- Diminishing returns for complexity

**Recommendation**: 
1. Run Experiments A-C (diagnostic deep dive)
2. If all fail (R² < 0), **pivot to publishing simple model results**
3. If any succeed (R² > 0.3), continue to Section 3

---

## SECTION 3 STATUS: ON HOLD

**Original Plan**: Architectural ablation study
- Simple CNN baseline
- + Spatial attention
- + Temporal attention
- + Multi-scale temporal attention

**Current Status**: ⏸️ **BLOCKED**

**Reason**: Must establish working baseline before testing architectural variants

**Prerequisite**: At least one configuration achieving **R² > 0** consistently

---

## ALTERNATIVE PATH: VALUABLE NULL RESULT PAPER

If neural networks continue to fail, pivot to:

**Title**: *"When Simple Models Win: Empirical Limits of Deep Learning for Cloud Base Height Prediction from Single-Wavelength IR Imagery"*

**Narrative**:
1. **Section 1**: Signal exists (r² = 0.14), simple models excel (R² = 0.75)
2. **Section 2**: Systematic neural network failures despite hyperparameter tuning
3. **Analysis**: Why gradient boosting > deep learning for this task
4. **Contribution**: Quantifying when added complexity doesn't help

**Venues**: 
- ICML 2026 "ML for Scientific Discovery" (as cautionary tale)
- NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks (as challenging benchmark)
- Remote Sensing journals (as applied ML analysis)

This is **still publication-worthy** - negative results are valuable!
