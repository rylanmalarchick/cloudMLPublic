# Quick Start: Diagnostic Analysis

**Status:** Ready to run NOW  
**Time:** 2-3 hours total  
**Goal:** Find out if your task is learnable BEFORE more training runs

---

## 🚨 Why This Matters

You've run 4 neural network experiments. **All failed** (R² < 0).

**Two possibilities:**
1. **Training issues** (variance collapse, bad init) → Fixable
2. **Task not learnable** from single-wavelength IR → Need different data

**These diagnostics tell you which one.** Don't waste more time guessing!

## 📊 What The Literature Says

From your papers:

**Himawari-8 (Yu et al.):**
- Used **16 channels** (visible + multiple IR bands)
- Success required multi-spectral data

**VIIRS/CrIS (Heidinger et al.):**
- Quote: *"imagers lack the IR channels in H2O and CO2 absorption bands needed for accurate thin ice cloud height estimation"*
- Single-wavelength IR **struggles** with cloud properties
- Needed 13.3-14.2 µm CO2 bands for accuracy

**Your task:**
- Single-wavelength IR only
- No CO2 absorption bands
- **This is HARDER than what the papers solved!**

**Possibility:** Your features may not contain enough information. Let's find out.

## 🔬 The Diagnostics (In Order)

### Step 1: Correlation Analysis (30 min)

**What it does:** Checks if ANY feature correlates with optical depth

**Run it:**
```bash
cd cloudMLPublic
python diagnostics/1_correlation_analysis.py
```

**What to look for:**
```
Best Pearson correlation:
  r² = 0.XXX (X% variance explained)

Decision: [✅ PROCEED | 🟡 CAUTION | 🔴 STOP]
```

**Interpretation:**
- **r² > 0.15:** Signal exists! 🎉 Proceed with confidence
- **r² = 0.05-0.15:** Weak signal, proceed carefully
- **r² < 0.05:** No signal, task likely not learnable from these features

---

### Step 2: Simple Baselines (1 hour)

**What it does:** Tests if Ridge/Random Forest can beat mean baseline

**Run it:**
```bash
python diagnostics/2_simple_baselines.py
```

**What to look for:**
```
Best Model: Random Forest
Test R²: 0.XXX

COMPARISON WITH YOUR NEURAL NETWORK RUNS
Best simple model:  R² = 0.XXX
Run 1 (neural net): R² = -0.0457
Run 2 (neural net): R² = -0.0226
Run 3 (neural net): R² = -0.2034
Run 4 (neural net): R² = -0.0655
```

**Critical questions:**
1. **If simple model R² > 0:** Signal exists, neural net should work too
   - Your NN failures = training issues (variance collapse, etc.)
   - **This is GOOD NEWS** - problems are fixable!

2. **If simple model R² < 0:** No model can beat mean
   - Data lacks learnable signal
   - Need different features or reformulate problem

## 🎯 Decision Matrix

| Correlation r² | Baseline R² | Decision | Next Steps |
|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| > 0.15 | > 0.2 | ✅ **Proceed with Run 5** | Task is learnable, fix training |
| 0.05-0.15 | 0.0-0.2 | 🟡 **Proceed carefully** | Weak signal, low expectations |
| < 0.05 | < 0 | 🔴 **STOP NN experiments** | Need different data/features |

## 🔍 Example Outcomes

### Scenario A: Good News! ✅
```
Correlation: r² = 0.22
Baseline: R² = 0.15 (Random Forest)
Neural nets: R² = -0.06 (all runs)

→ Simple models BEAT your neural networks!
→ Your data HAS signal, but NN training is broken
→ Fix: Run 5 with variance_lambda=2.0 should work
```

### Scenario B: Bad News 🔴
```
Correlation: r² = 0.03
Baseline: R² = -0.08 (all models)
Neural nets: R² = -0.06 (all runs)

→ No model can learn from these features
→ Single-wavelength IR doesn't contain enough info
→ Recommendation: Need multi-spectral data or different task
```

## 💡 If Diagnostics Show "Not Learnable"

**This is NOT a failure!** You've discovered important scientific insight:

1. **Systematic analysis** - Tested hypothesis properly
2. **Clear recommendation** - Need multi-wavelength sensors
3. **Valuable findings** for your internship report

**What to write in your report:**
- Investigated deep learning for cloud optical depth prediction
- Performed systematic diagnostic analysis
- Found single-wavelength IR has insufficient information
- Recommend: Multi-spectral approach (cite Heidinger et al.)
- This is proper scientific methodology!

## 🤝 Your Internship Is Not "Bullshit"

Even if diagnostics show "not learnable":

✅ You systematically investigated deep learning  
✅ You identified data limitations  
✅ You can make informed recommendations  
✅ You used proper scientific methodology  
✅ Your report will have clear conclusions  

**This is exactly what research looks like!**

Not every hypothesis works out. But identifying **why** and **what's needed** is valuable scientific contribution.

## Next Steps After Diagnostics

**If results are GOOD (r² > 0.1, baseline R² > 0):**
1. Run 5 with increased variance_lambda=2.0
2. Architecture ablation (temporal_frames 3 vs 5 vs 7)
3. Write success report

**If results are BAD (all R² < 0):**
1. Document findings clearly
2. Recommend multi-spectral approach
3. Discuss physical limitations
4. Suggest alternative formulations (classification?)
5. Write honest, scientific report
